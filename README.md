## Summary
This is a JS expense tracker. The user can select from a selection of currencies, enter details about the item purchased, and add the item to a table that displays the items.
These are the highlights of this project: 
-Naturally builds on skills/knowledge used building a JS ToDo App.
-HTML, CSS scaffolding on this project is basic and quick.  Definately room to get creative.
-The JavaScript for this project required me to stretch my JS logic muscles, easily the best part of this project:
 -breaking down the functionality into digestable pieces.
 -while building the smaller pieces my understanding of functions, function scope, data type selection, and using loops was greatly enhanced!
